#Spring-Mass Simulation

This is a Python-based spring-mass system simulation project that uses the Euler method to solve the motion equation and generates an animated GIF to demonstrate the motion process of the mass block

#function

a.Euler method simulates the spring mass system

b.matplotlib dynamic visualization

c.tkinter obtains user input parameters

d.Generate animated images and export them as GIFs

#Usage method

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
